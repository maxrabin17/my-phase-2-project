## React Breaking Bad App
Welcome to my Breaking Bad App! This is an app that allows you to search for your favorite characters throughout all of the show Breaking Bad. You can add your favorite characters with the click of a button, and they will be displayed on the home page!

As an added bonus you can also retrieve random quotes from throughout the series, you can also add these to the homepage.

*Unfortunately I am having difficulties with deploying this app through GitHub Pages. In the meantime, feel free to clone down my repo and follow the steps below!*

## Usage
- Run json-server --watch db.json in your terminal.
- Create a new terminal and run npm start, and provide prompt with "Y" response to open a seperate port.
- Head over to Character Page and add whichever character's are your favorite. (Your favorite Characters will be persisted onto the home page.)
- Head to the Quotes Page and click the "Get Random Quote" button to render a random quote from the API.
- Click "Add to Favorites" if you like the quote or "Get Random Quote" to render a different quote. (Your Favorite Quotes will also be persisted to the Home Page)
- Click "Remove" on any of your Favorite Quotes or Characters (on the Home Page) to remove them from the Page and the backend.

## Final
Thank you for using my React Breaking Bad App!
